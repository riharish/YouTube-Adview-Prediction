YouTube AdView Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to predict the number of ad views a YouTube video will receive based on various input features such as category, duration, likes, comments, and other metadata. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that can help advertisers optimize their ad performance.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset consists of YouTube video metadata, including:

Video Category: The category under which the video is classified.
Duration: The length of the video.
Likes & Dislikes: User engagement metrics.
Comments: The number of comments on the video.
Views: The total number of views (used as the target variable for prediction).
Published Date: The date the video was uploaded.
