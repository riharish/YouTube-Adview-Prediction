# YouTube AdView Prediction  

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the number of ad views a YouTube video will receive based on key metadata such as video category, duration, likes, comments, and other engagement metrics. By leveraging machine learning models, the goal is to build a system that helps advertisers and content creators optimize their strategies for maximizing ad performance.  

## Dataset Description  
The dataset contains various features that influence ad views, including the video category, duration, number of likes and dislikes, comment count, and total views. Additionally, the published date is considered to analyze trends over time. These attributes are preprocessed and transformed to ensure accurate predictions.  

## Methodology  
The project follows a structured workflow, starting with data preprocessing, where missing values are handled, categorical features are encoded, and numerical variables are scaled. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to identify correlations and patterns within the dataset. Various regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, are trained and evaluated using metrics such as R² score, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.  

## Model Training and Evaluation  
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure generalization. Multiple machine learning models are implemented, and their performances are compared to select the most accurate one. Feature importance analysis is conducted to understand which factors contribute most to ad view predictions. The final model is chosen based on its ability to minimize errors and provide reliable results.  

## Implementation and Usage  
The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The trained model can be used to predict ad views for new videos by providing relevant input features.   

## Results and Insights  
The best-performing model, Random Forest achieved the highest R² score, indicating a strong relationship between the input features and the predicted ad views. Insights from the analysis suggest that factors like video category, user engagement (likes and comments), and duration significantly impact ad performance.  

## Conclusion  
This project provides a data-driven approach to estimating YouTube ad views, helping marketers and content creators make informed decisions. Future improvements may include incorporating external factors like trending topics or user demographics to enhance prediction accuracy.
